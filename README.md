# differentiatie-between-fruit-images
Python code that used Ai to differentiate and categorise images of different fruits.
Replace 'path_to_image_directory', 'path_to_csv_file', and 'path_to_output_directory' with the actual paths in your system. The CSV file should have two columns: the image filename and its corresponding fruit label.
This code reads the CSV file, iterates through each row, and moves the corresponding image to the appropriate folder based on the fruit label. If the output folders don't exist, they will be created. The images will be organized into separate folders based on their fruit labels.
